NAME
    Parrot::AssemblyTokenizer

DESCRIPTION
    Tokenizes Parrot Assembly Language

SYNOPSIS
            use Parrot::AssemblyTokenizer;
        
            my @tokens = Parrot::AssemblyTokenizer::tokenize( $lines_of_pasm );
        
METHODS
  tokenize

    Tokenizes a scalar containing PASM ... scalar can be multiline, and
    it'll do *The Right Thing*. Returns a list of array references, that
    contain the token type and the token data. Tokens can be: whitespace,
    comment, label, operation, argument, comma, single_quoted_string,
    double_quoted_string.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This is not a parser. This was written as a helper module to allow me to
    do syntax highlighting of PASM - note its lack of caring about what type
    an argument is. No known bugs.
